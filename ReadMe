Hello! Welcome to our repository. The goal and purpose of our repository is to create a user interface for student and professor
all around. We created a GUI with C#/ visual stuido and connected it to a "Mysql" database. This allows student to view their schedule 
and their grades. Students will also be able to calculate their GPA. While Admins can view and modify data for all enrolled students. 
The data will include tests,courses,final grades, usernames and passwords. 


-To Run program: Create schema called " software_eng"
-Import data from folder from Github, "software_eng(1)" using Mysql import data feature
-To run GUI, download full folder "Connection V5, open "Final_version_2.zip". Make sure to change password found in all four fourms,
  to match your mysql workbench password. (Password change will be found in line starting with "string constring") 
 -Run "Connection.sln"
-Student username and passwords will be found in "student_tbl"
-Administrator username and passwords will found in "admin_tbl"
